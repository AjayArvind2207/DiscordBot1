# DiscordBot1
Bot on discord intended for scraping facts of the internet and posting them when a command is used. Other features include accessibility features for making online school more effortless, as well as a few commands intended for fun.

# Features

Bot is written entirely in Python with all scraping and storage systems coming from Python related modules such as BeautifulSoup, Requests, or even JSON access through Python
It is hosted on heroku so as to ensure that it is always running.
The bot was initially coded by me during the start of lockdown as a boredom project and eventually evolved into something that I use regularly due to its ease of use.
